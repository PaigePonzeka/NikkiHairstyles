                 <p> My name is Nikki Santopietro and welcome to my site. </p>
                 <p>
                 Ever since I gave my first Barbie a haircut when I was young, Iâ€™ve loved to cut and style hair. In 2007 I graduated from The Long Island Institute of Beauty and Hairstyling and that was the being of my amazing journey.
               </p>
               <p>
                Before even graduating from Beauty School, I had the honor of being the head of Hairstyling for Centereach High Schools Theatre Department. Theatre has always had a peice of my heart, and in 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th grade I studied the art of hairstyling with my passion of theatre along side of it. Creating looks for each and every actor , for each and every theatre show, year to year.
               </p>
               <p>
                In addition to passing all of my final tests with high scores in Beauty School, I also received awards and won competitions for bridal hairstyling. I specialize now in working with brides, creating updos and styles that can be worn every day or for that special wedding day! Each and every weekend for me is spent creating hairstyles for special events/weddings and that is a dream for me come true!
               </p>
               <p> Help me make your hair dream a realty!
